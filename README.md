ElevatorChallenge Problem Statement:
---

Design and implement an elevator control system. What data structures, interfaces and algorithms will you need? Your elevator control system should be able to handle a few elevators â€” up to 16.

You can use the language of your choice to implement an elevator control system. In the end, your control system should provide an interface for:

Querying the state of the elevators (what floor are they on and where they are going), receiving an update about the status of an elevator, receiving a pickup request, time-stepping the simulation. For example, we could imagine in Scala an interface like this:

```
trait ElevatorControlSystem { 
    def status(): Seq[(Int, Int, Int)] 
    def update(Int, Int, Int) 
    def pickup(Int, Int) 
    def step() 
} 
```

Here we have chosen to represent elevator state as 3 integers:

Elevator ID, Floor Number, Goal Floor Number

A pickup request is two integers:

Pickup Floor, Direction (negative for down, positive for up)

This is not a particularly nice interface, and leaves some questions open. For example, the elevator state only has one goal floor; but it is conceivable that an elevator holds more than one person, and each person wants to go to a different floor, so there could be a few goal floors queued up. Please feel free to improve upon this interface!

The most interesting part of this challenge is the scheduling problem. The simplest implementation would be to serve requests in FCFS (first-come, first-served) order. This is clearly bad; imagine riding such an elevator! Please discuss how your algorithm improves on FCFS in your write-up.

Please provide a source tarball containing code in the language of your choice, as well as a README discussing your solution (and providing build instructions). The accompanying documentation is an important part of your submission. It counts to show your work.

Good luck!

**Current Solution:**
- Elevator Controller decides how to divide up requests to elevators by first using idle elevators
- Elevator data class contains all of the knowledge of how an elevator should move once it has requests
- The scheduling solution here is that each elevator moves in a single direction until it empties its queue of stops to hit
    - It will reject attempts by users of the elevator to push a button that will ask the elevator to move in the opposite direction to which it is currently traveling
    - Once the elevator has run out of stops, it will set itself as available for the Controller to assign new stops which again are all in the same direction
    - This is potentially better than FCFS because stops which 'make sense' to stop at will be taken automatically
    - By performing complete moves in each direction before an elevator switches directions, it will ensure that there is no starvation for faraway floors
    - By maintaining a FCFS queue of requests, even if it isn't the most efficient way of handling waiting requests, we prevent starvation in the queue
- Requests are a data class storing the information of each pickup or dropoff request
- Directions are a single enum

**Assumptions:**
- We cannot receive multiple requests from the same floor in the same direction
    - This is therefore not dealt with


**Future work, *in order of importance*:**
- While this work primarily used current elevator implementations as inspiration, the real problem here is that of knowledge being given at different times - the earlier it is known, the better planning can occur
    - The 'pickUp' method should then be changed to get both the start floor and the stop floor
    - The additional information known ahead of time will allow us to plan better for elevator utilization
    - For example we have more information about how well requests cluster together and how we can prioritize them to be serviced; something that we can maintain within the priority queue alongside request age (which is what we are currently prioritizing for only)
- We should take into account the distance that an elevator needs to travel to service the next request not just the number of requests it currently has
    - Specifically, line 116 of ElevatorController.kt should use the minimum of the distance combined with the load factor of the elevator, rather than just the load factor 
- Requests are two different concepts currently stuck together for ease of development: pickups and drop-offs
    - These two should be pulled apart and not used interchangeably as they are both confusing and will lead non-single time-pressured projects into poor maintainability and 'bad-smelling' code
- Similarly, directions are currently used simultaneously for the 'desired direction' of an elevator client as well as the direction the elevator is currently traveling in. These should be split apart as well.
- Non-trivial tests should be used
